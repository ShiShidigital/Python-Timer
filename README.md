# Python-Timer
A Timer written in Python for practice.


### The very basic Timer is Version 1

Simple command line Timer. Give it minutes to count down on. It will Beep when time is up.

<b>Timer Version 1</b> -> <a href='timer_v1.py'>timer_v1.py</a>

<hr>

New features will be added and published here:

<b>Version 1.1</b> --> <a href='timer_v1.py'>timer_v1.1.py</a>
Now it's possible to set up the Timer with hh:mm:ss format.
