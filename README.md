A Timer written in Python for practice.


## The very basic Timer is Version 1

Simple command line Timer. Give it minutes to count down on. It will Beep when time is up.

<b>Timer Version 1</b> -> <a href='timer_v1.py'>timer_v1.py</a>

### New features will be added and published here:

<b>Version 1.1</b> --> <a href='timer_v1.py'>timer_v1.1.py</a>
Now it's possible to set up the Timer with hh:mm:ss format.

<b>Version 1.3</b> --> <a href='timer_v1.py'>timer_v1.3.py</a>
Now there are some preset Timers to choose from at start.
There will be an alert pop-up on the screen when the time is up.

### For Windows 
There is now an executable version for Windows. 
You need to download the file 'timer.exe' to a Windows system for it to work.
This is on the latest version 1.3
